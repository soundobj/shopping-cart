This is a barebones implementation of Redux with a React app that was generated with `create-react-app`, and then ejected with `npm run eject`.

Items are presented one at a time, in a list, identified by name - for
example "Apple" or “Banana".
* The basket can contain any item multiple times. Items are priced as
follows:
* Apples are 25 ct each
* Oranges are 30 ct each
* Bananas are 15 ct each
* Papayas are 50 ct each, but are available as ‘three for the price of
two’
* Given a shopping list with items, calculate the total cost of those items.
* The output shall be displayed similar to what you would expect to see
on a receipt.
